	<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27524199">Change in the Molecular Dimension of a RAGE-Ligand Complex Triggers RAGE Signaling</a>

	<p class="leftB">The weak oligomerization exhibited by many transmembrane receptors has a profound effect on signal transduction. The phenomenon is difficult to characterize structurally due to the large sizes of and transient interactions between monomers. The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), a signaling molecule central to the induction and perpetuation of inflammatory responses, is a weak constitutive oligomer. 
	</p>
	<p>
	The RAGE domain interaction surfaces that mediate homo-dimerization were identified by combining segmental isotopic labeling of extracellular soluble RAGE (sRAGE) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy with chemical cross-linking and mass spectrometry. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Molecular modeling suggests that two sRAGE monomers orient head to head forming an asymmetric dimer with the C termini directed toward the cell membrane. Ligand-induced association of RAGE homo-dimers on the cell surface increases the molecular dimension of the receptor, recruiting Diaphanous 1 (DIAPH1) and activating signaling pathways.

	<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24824951">The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) specifically recognizes methylglyoxal-derived AGEs</a>

	<p class="leftB">Diabetes-induced hyperglycemia increases the extracellular concentration of methylglyoxal. Methylglyoxal-derived hydroimidazolones (MG-H) form advanced glycation end products (AGEs) that accumulate in the serum of diabetic patients. The binding of hydroimidozolones to the receptor for AGEs (RAGE) results in long-term complications of diabetes typified by vascular and neuronal injury. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Here we show that binding of methylglyoxal-modified albumin to RAGE results in signal transduction. Chemically synthesized peptides containing hydroimidozolones bind specifically to the V domain of RAGE with nanomolar affinity. 
	</p>
	<p>
	The solution structure of an MG-H1-V domain complex revealed that the hydroimidazolone moiety forms multiple contacts with a positively charged surface on the V domain. The high affinity and specificity of hydroimidozolones binding to the V domain of RAGE suggest that they are the primary AGE structures that give rise to AGEs-RAGE pathologies.
